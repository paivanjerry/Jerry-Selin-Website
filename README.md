# Jerry Selin Websites


## Getting Started

Use Flutter channel beta to enable web.

Use "flutter run -d chrome" to serve app and "flutter build web" to build release.

Live version running at https://jerrysel.in


## Purpose of this project

First of all, this project is my portfolio page. I decided to try something new for building my pages. And I made the building with Flutter.

Secondly, Flutter web is available only at Flutter beta channel. The web part of Flutter has still a lot to improve. Implementing traditional web features like changing html title when page changes can be hacky sometimes. Feel free to take some hacking inspiration from this project.

Some standard web features implemented in this project:
- Html page title following the navigation, translation change and page change affects the title.
- Implementing html page for browsers that does not support Flutter web (Javascript implementation).
